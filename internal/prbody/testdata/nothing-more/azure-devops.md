Acme keeps its shared engineering files (agent instructions, editor and CI settings) in one hub.
Review this like any other change; questions go to the platform team's channel.

touchmark syncs packs `agents`, `claude` and `base` from the hub `acme-eng` ([`github.com/acme/engineering-assets`](https://redirect.github.com/acme/engineering-assets)) at commit [`3f2c1ab9d8e7`](https://redirect.github.com/acme/engineering-assets/commit/3f2c1ab9d8e7f6a5b4c3d2e1f0a9b8c7d6e5f4a3).

### Changes

| Change | File | Pack |
|---|---|---|
| create | `prompts/review.md` | `agents` |

### Nothing more to sync

The hub proposes nothing more for this repository: the default branch has the hub's versions of these files, or they are ignored or changed here. This branch has commits touchmark did not make, so touchmark leaves this pull request open. Close it, or keep your commits and merge it.

---

If this pull request is closed without merging, touchmark remembers it and does not propose the same changes again; a new one comes when the hub changes these files. Editing `packs` or `ignore` in `.engineering-assets.yml` resets that memory, and `ignore` opts a file out for good. To have the same changes proposed again sooner, the hub's maintainers can add a `forget_declines` entry with the number of this pull request to `.touchmark/operations.yml`. touchmark rewrites this description, so please comment instead of editing it.
